## Lore 📕

All the plushies were in harmony until a group of blahajs became mischievous due to being ignored and turned into evil blahajs. While many tried exterminating them, others took a different approach and made them friendly and useful to every plushie, though they retained an evil look and personality. 

Among them was a cat named Cat? (But not to be confused with Lilleplutt!) A peculiar name, but that was indeed his name, and he was much rarer than the other stuffed animals.

There were also useful items called cart tokens, which unlocked more carts and made transporting easier, thereby granting more rewards.
